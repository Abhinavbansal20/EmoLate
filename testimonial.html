                        Hi, I am Aashka. Recently, I have been having anxiety due to my college admissions. I am unable to sleep at night, and am very nervous. I was recommended Emolate by a friend of mine. I bought the subscription pack of 365 Calmness dozes, each lasting for
                        15 minutes. They can be used twice per day. At night, now I have a time period of 15 minutes, where I can easily sleep. I hope to recover from Anxiety soon, but till then I am relying on Emolate. Am I relying on it too much? I
                        think yes, I hope I dont get addicted to this. But hey, good addictions aren't bad.... right? I bought the waist transmitter, and got the chip installed in my vertebra as I wanted immediate effect of the Emotion.

                        I am Prakash, a Criminal- Lawyer. For a criminal lawyer, I am too soft-spoken. I wanted to be angry, angrier at the criminals who are defended by the 'so-called' public prosecutors. My emotion had to be devoid of sympathy, as these criminals deserve nothing
                        but punishment. The excess emotion of <b>'anger'</b> combined with emotoions of <b>'hostility'</b> and <b>'apathy'</b> now makes me feel better while fighting against these criminals. Justice shall prevail.
                        I take these emotions right before any court-case and have successfully convicted 75+ criminals. I am enjoying this. My sense of justice is getting better; yesterday- my 11 year old daughter did not finish her glass of milk. Justice
                        was done- a slap! Guess what, I did not install these emotions before delivering the slap! Finally, I am inheriting this. That's what justice is all about, punish the wrong doers. I thank Emo-Late to provide these emotions so freely
                        to everyone, making the world a better place. Phew.......

                        Hi, I am Rahul, a budding entrepreneur. I am shy and na√Øve by nature. Recently, I wanted to pitch my ideas for funding to a business magnate. I was super nervous. I bought the Emo-Late Emotion of Confidence, which boosted my confidence 5 times, each for
                        a period for 12 days. I had the chip installed in my wrist, since I did not require immediate effect. I have used the confidence emotion 2-3 times, and I feel underconfident without it. Do I feel more underconfident after subscribing
                        to this emotion? Yes! But that doesn't matter since I was underconfident before installing this emotion too. Underconfidence is worrying, but so can be over-confidence. I felt a little dizzy after the surgery, but the dizziness
                        went away after a few hours. I advise you to have the wrist surgery atleast 1 week in advance before your scheduled installation.
                    </p>
