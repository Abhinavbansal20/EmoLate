                            electrical signals into those cells, which are transmitted to all other neural endings of the body. Depending upon the strength of the electric signal, the body is now able to exhibit a new emotion, over the original one.</p>

                <p class="descText">Emo-Late identifies the personality type of all its users. It is understood that different emotions affect different Myers-Briggs Personality Types differently. Hence, we recommend to try our Personality Test before entering the Emo-Late
                    Marketplace. There are 16 different personalities, and the emotions will affect your personality in a different way. No answer is incorrect in the personality test.

                <p class="descText">The effect on the body is only projected, it may vary slightly depending upon prior medical conditions of the user. For enhanced medical guidance on the affect of these emotions on your health, Emo-Late provides Medical Consultancy, which
                    needs to be paid for additionally. We also offer subscription plans for the same.
                </p>
                <p class="descText">All the emotions are tried and tested before they are put up for sale in the market. Additional number of uses can be bought by making additional payments to Emo-Late. Please note that after some time, the effect of emotions displayed
                    will diminish as the body cells tend to get used to the electrical synapses, and start rejecting it. It is therefore advised that the same emotion is not used periodically and the guilelines of Emo-Late are thoroughly followed.
                </p>
                <p class="descText"> Also note, that using the same emotion over and over agin may change your body hormonal balances, and may affect your innate personality. Hence, we recommend you to take the personality tests after using emotions with prolonged effects.
